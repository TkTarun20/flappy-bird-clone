# flappy-bird-clone
The clone of the famous game "Flappy Bird", originally developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen. 

As an aspiring Python Developer, I have tried to build the replica of "Flappy Bird" game using python library called "pygame".
Suggestions, if any, will be appreciated!

How to play:
 -> Press 'Space' to start the game.
 -> Press 'Up' to jump.
 -> Avoid collision with pipes and ground to not get killed.
